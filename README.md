Problem Statement:
A grocery store wants to calculate the total cost of items purchased by a customer.
- Calculate the total cost of 3 different items.
- Add a 10% discount if the total exceeds $50.
- Display the final payable amount.

Approach:
First take all the three inputs, then initialise the discount as 0 but if the total is about 50 then update the discount to 10% of total and at last print the final amount as total-discount.

Sample Output:

Welcome to the store..........

Enter price of item 1: 22
Enter price of item 2: 34
Enter price of item 3: 56

		Total price:  112
		Discount applied: 11.20
		Final amount: 100.80
