Problem Statement:
A grocery store wants to calculate the total cost of items purchased by a customer.
- Calculate the total cost of 3 different items.
- Add a 10% discount if the total exceeds $50.
- Display the final payable amount.

Approach:
First take all the three inputs, then initialise the discount as 0 but if the total is about 50 then update the discount to 10% of total and at last print the final amount as total-discount.

Sample Output:
Enter price of item 1: 15
Enter price of item 2: 25
Enter price of item 3: 30
Total price:  70
Discount applied:  7.0
Final amount:  63.0
